Description: Python iptables ruleset library
 Python module for programmatically creating low level iptables rule sets.
 Oinkwall aims at reducing friction of handling IPv4 and IPv6 rule sets in
 parallel and handling the resolving of IP addresses via DNS, including network
 subnet definitions, while not restricting the freedom of the user.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.
